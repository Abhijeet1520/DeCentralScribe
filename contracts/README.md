## DeCentralScribe Contracts

ERC-1155 based contract handling minting of NFTs for blog access 

1. **TokenUtils.sol**:
   - The `createTokenId` function seems fine. It generates a unique token ID based on the creator's address, article ID, and whether it's a paying article.
   - The `parseTokenId` function extracts the creator's address, article ID, and whether it's a paying article from a token ID.
   - The `findAlternateId` function finds the alternate ID by switching the "isPaying" bit. It can be useful for certain functionalities like swapping paid/free articles.

2. **IdTracker.sol**:
   - This contract seems to track the IDs of articles for each creator.
   - It has a function to check the validity of an ID and to increment the tracked ID for a specific creator.

3. **DonationAggregator.sol**:
   - This contract is responsible for aggregating donations made to authors.
